    m_Localized: "The player can hunt, collect and fight dinosaurs using his phone\u2019s
      camera\r\nWhen catching a fossil, the player can interact with the development
      of the game: by placing the fossil wherever he wants to him or other players
      catch in the future\r\nEach dinosaur has a card associated with it\r\nThe player
      can collect the dinosaurs\u2019 cards and use them in battles\r\nThe battles
      are fought by applying the AR capabilities of player\u2019s phone\r\nDuring
      battles, when the cards are visible by the camera, a dinosaur is spawned on
      top of it\r\nWhile battling the player can give instructions to the dinosaur
      to fight the other player\u2019s ancient animal\r\nWhile in hunting mode, the
      game is played only by one person\r\nThere is the possibility to fight against
      other players\u2019 dinosaurs which turn the game into a multiplayer game\r\nThis
      battle has a duration of 2 to 5 minutes long\r\nThe player interaction with
      the game does not have a defined time because it is the user's choice to take
      time learning dinosaur characteristics\r\nIt can also be played by any age,
      under almost every circumstance: deaf, color blinded, disabled people, seniors
      and foreigners\r\n\r\nThe player needs to get some cards to start playing\r\nIn
      a normal situation, the cards would be bought in a store, and then the player
      could scan the cards\r\nEach card refers to a single dinosaur, and from the
      moment a player scans the card, it goes into the inventory and becomes part
      of the set of cards that the user can use in battle.\r\n\r\nAll the scanned
      cards are in the player's inventory\r\nThe player can investigate each of the
      dinosaurs to learn about them.\r\nThe undiscovered dinosaurs are hidden by
      a black silhouette, and all the information the user can get is their type:
      lizard, air, water, ground\u2026\r\nThe player can get/update profile information
      as well as see other players' rankings\r\n\r\nWhen the player chooses to fight
      against another player, first he needs to select a dinosaur and then place
      a spawn card on the table/floor visible to the phone\u2019s camera\r\nDuring
      the fight, the player chooses to attack, dodge, or defend from the opponent\u2019s
      attack\r\nWhen winning, the winner\u2019s dinosaur gets rewarded with XP, which
      is used to level up the dinosaur and even to evolve it\r\nIf the player loses,
      he needs to use in-game currency to buy energy bottles to cure the dinosaur\r\nIn-game
      currency can be earned by completing missions or by buying items in the store
      (with real money)\r\nWinning or losing, the player can check his ranking as
      well as other players' rankings\r\nThis ranking is calculated based on the
      player's dinosaurs\u2019 eXPerience\r\nA player\u2019s experience determines
      his ranking and is the sum of his dinosaur\u2019s XP\r\nThe player can check
      their dinosaurs to take care of them, and check if they can be evolved to a
      new and better version of themselves\r\n\r\nThe player can interact with the
      game's development by interfering with other players' progress\r\nIf the player
      finds a fossil, which can be a physical card, he can \u201Cseed\u201D the fossil,
      so in that region other players can only find that type of dinosaur"
