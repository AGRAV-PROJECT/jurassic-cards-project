    m_Localized: "Jurassic Cards was developed as part of the Advanced Graphical
      Applications course (AGRAV), which began in the second semester of the second
      year of the Master\u2019s in Computer Engineering in the branch of Graphic
      and Multimedia Systems at the Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto (ISEP)
      - Academic Year 2022/2023.\r\n\r\nThe game was developed under the guidance
      of teacher Paula Escudeiro by the following members of Group 01: Andr\xE9 Gon\xE7alves
      (1191660), Andr\xE9 Morais (1210626), Daniel Dias (1181488), Francisco Dias
      (1180615), Lu\xEDs Sousa (1170987), Miguel Cabeleira (1210632), Narciso Correia
      (1200174), Sofia Canelas (1200185), and V\xEDtor Neto (1210130).\r\n\r\nThe
      purpose of the game is to instruct players about dinosaurs while they play
      and have fun. Location services are used on a representative map of the user\u2019s
      country, which allows the user to discover it while interacting with other
      elements placed by other players (fossils). The game also features AR capabilities
      to scan the physical cards and to battle with other players. Adding to this,
      the game has the objective of being inclusive, providing easier ways for deaf,
      disabled, colorblind, and senior people to play the game.\r\n"
