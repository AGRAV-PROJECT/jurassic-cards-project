      start the first attack.

      After launch, players will have 10 seconds
      to choose which dinosaur they will use.

      Each player can only attack
      in their turn and these attacks are interspersed between players.

      Every
      3 attacks, the player has the option to launch a special attack, that is, if
      the player launches a special attack on the first attack, on the next two he
      will not be able to do so, being forced to launch a basic attack.

      Every
      5 attacks, the player has the option to launch a protection, that is, if the
      player launches a protection in the first attack, in the next 4 he will not
      be able to do so, being forced to launch a basic attack.

      First to kill
      the enemy wins.'
